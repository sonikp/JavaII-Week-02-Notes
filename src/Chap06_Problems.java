		 * Conditional Execution
		 * 
		 * Something that executes a block of code of some condition is true
		 * 
		 * - for
		 * - if 
		 * - if/else
		 * - if/else if/ele
		 * - while
		 * 
		 * Short Circuit Evaluation
		 * 
		 * when you use a combination of && expressions in a statement, both expressions
		 * must be true for the statement to execute. When the first expression isn't true
		 * the second one won't be tested, this is called a short circuit expression
		 * 
		 * Chromakey
		 * 
		 * Chromakey is the process of removing a background in one image and replacing the subject onto another background
		 * this is the technique used for the weatherman
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Sepia-tint
		 * 
		 * Sepia toned tint is often representative of older style black and white pictures
		 * with a yellowish tint to them. This is achieved by breaking the picture into high, middle, and low
		 * ranges of color and changing them separately.
		 * lowest = darkest gray's a bit darker
		 * middle = a bit browner
		 * high = a bit yellowish
		 * 
		 * Edge detection
		 * 
		 * Edge detection is identifying high contrast between neighbouring pixels and assuming this is the edge of a 
		 * subject. 
		 * 
		 * Blurring
		 * 
		 * Blurring can be used to smooth out pixelization. This is done by setting each pixel to an average of the pixels around it.
