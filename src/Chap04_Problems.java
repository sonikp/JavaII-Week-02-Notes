		 * Question 4.4
		 * 
		 * RGB = Red, green, blue
		 * 
		 * each pixel uses 24 bits to represent the RGB colors, therefore 2^24 color combinations, or 16,777,216 colors
		 * Yes, that is adequate for our perception
		 */
		
		/*
		 * Question 4.3
		 * 
		 * because the color is represented by 8 bits, 2^8 therefore that is 256 discrete
		 * numbers or 0-255
		 * 
		 */
		
		
		/*
		 * 
		 * Question 4.2
		 * 
		 * Why don't we see red, green and blue spots at each position in our picture
		 * 
		 * Human eyes are not sensitive enough to perceive the individual color representations/

		/*
		 * 
		 * Question 4.1
		 * 
		 * What is meant by each of the following:
		 * 
		 * Pixel; the smallest unit of a dot that comprises a bitmap picture, representing a single color unit
		 * 
		 * Kilobyte; a byte = 8 bits, and 1000 bytes, makes up a unit of measure of memory. 2^10 or 1024 bytes
		 * 
		 * RGB; red, green, blue
		 * 
		 * Loop; a repetitave event that repeats until a trigger causes it to stop
		 * 
		 * HSV; a different way to represent pictures, Hue, Saturation, Value(Brightness)
		 * 
		 * Flowchart: is a visual representation of the execution method or function of a program
		 * 
		 * Infinite Loop: a loop that never ends
		 * 
		 * Variable Scope: the scope of a variable is the area in which th variable is known
		 * If the variable is declared inside a method, it is within scope, however, outside
		 * that method it is not known, or out of scope
		 * 
		 * Array: an array is a sequence of elements, each with an index number associated with it.
		 * 
		 * Matrix: is a two dimensional array. A matrix is a collection of elements arranged in both a horizontal and vertical
		 * sequence
		 * 
		 * Column-Major order, representation of a two dimensional array, column first then row. column, row, x, y means 
		 * x = column, y = row. Row major would be x,y x = row, y = column. Pictures are usually column-major
		 * 
		 * Pixelization: the effect when digitization of a picture becomes obvious
		 * 
		 * Luminance; is not the amount of light, but how bright we percieve it.
